# Yummy: Search for Food Recipes | Interview Task for [Almentor.net](https://about.almentor.net/home)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.
## App Idea
This project is a simple app where users could search for food recipes with keywords or could explore the recipes of a specific cuisine type

### API
This app built using [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/)
- Spoonacular API allows a limited number of requests per day (free plan), so you will notice that the number of resulted recipes are just 6 recipes. 

## Demo

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
