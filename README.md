# Yummy: Search for Food Recipes | Almentor Interview Task

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.
## App Idea
This project is a simple app where users could search for food recipes with keywords or could explore the recipes of a specific cuisine type

### API
This app built using [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/)
- Spoonacular API allows a limited number of requests per day (free plan), so you will notice that the number of resulted recipes are just 6 recipes. 

## Demo
- You can preview a live demo for the app from [here](https://yummy-food-recipes.netlify.app/)
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
